- build.bat should compile/run tests when we get a little later on down the line.
- HTTPS enable? Won't matter so long as this is just a self-hosted sort of project prolly.
- Would be cool to auto-generate API documentation, or endpoints for REST API if possible.
- Finish setting up DB, remove static/db if you end up not using it
